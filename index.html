					How does the process work when selling your home to Dumpy House Buyers?
				</div>
				<div class="collapsible-body">
					If you’re interested in selling your home to Dumpy House Buyers, the steps listed below will put your mind at ease. 
					Here’s the home buying process:
					<ul class="faq-list">
						<li>
						Call us at (123) 456-7890 or fill out our contact form to give us some simple information about your home.
						</li>
						<li>

						your home’s condition, before making a fair, no-obligation offer to purchase your home for cash. Accepting our cash offer is 
						all up to you.
						</li>
						<li>
						If you accept the offer, we’ll set up a closing usually within 30 days. We’ll pay cash for your home, pay all normal

					Can I expect a market value offer for my home?
				</div>
				<div class="collapsible-body"> 
					When selling your home, we will consider the condition of your home, and will make a fair offer to pay cash. In determining 
					the offer, we will discount from the estimated retail value after it’s fully renovated. This means we will buy your home, but 
					at a price that is below market value due to necessary repairs, renovation and other factors. We buy homes for cash, renovate 
					them, and resell them for a profit or rent them out to qualified tenants.
					<br />
					However, you will enjoy the conveniences of an all cash closing when selling your home to Dumpy House Buyers. You won’t have to 
					deal with any mortgage approval hassles, you won’t have to pay any normal closing costs, and you don’t have to make repairs to your 
					home. Close in 30 days of receiving an offer for cash, and you’re out of your dumpy house.
